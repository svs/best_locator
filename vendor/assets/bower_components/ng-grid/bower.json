(JqueryUi draggable for non-HTML5 compliant browsers to use awesome Drag-N-Drop aggregate feature. However, you can still groupby without draggability)\n\n***\n\n## About\n__ng-grid__ Originally built on knockout we wanted to port it to angular.\n\nversion 2.0.7\n\n[nuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/ng-grid)\n\n\nQuestions, Comments, Complaints? feel free to email us at nggridteam@gmail.com\n\n***\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe are going to be adding more features here as we head to a 3.0 release, including:\n\n* Anything else the rest of the community wants to contribute that isn't a terrible idea. :)\n\n***\n_The bare bones_:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"angular.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ng-grid.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    angular.module('myApp',['ngGrid', ... {other includes}]);\n</script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../ng-grid.css\" /> \n<body ng-app=\"myApp\">\n    <div ng-grid=\"myOptions\"></div>\n</body>\n```\n```javascript\n// Define your own controller somewhere..\nfunction MyCtrl($scope) {\n\t$scope.myData = [{name: \"Moroni\", age: 50},\n                     {name: \"Teancum\", age: 43},\n                     {name: \"Jacob\", age: 27},\n                     {name: \"Nephi\", age: 29},\n                     {name: \"Enos\", age: 34}];\n\t$scope.myOptions = { data: 'myData' };\n\t// you can also specify data as: $scope.myOptions = { data: $scope.myData }. \n\t// However, updates to the underlying data will not be reflected in the grid\n};\n\n```\n\n## Want More?\nCheck out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/wiki/Getting-started) and other [Docs](https://github.com/angular-ui/ng-grid/wiki)\n\n## Examples\n[Examples](http://angular-ui.github.com/ng-grid/)\n\n## Testing\n\nThe testing setup is based on the [angular-seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/).\n\nMake sure to set your CHROME_BIN environment variable to the full path to chrome.exe (not just its directory).\n\n### Grunt tasks\n\nThere are a few grunt tasks for running tests:\n    \n    # Run unit tests\n    > grunt karma:unit\n    # Or use this alias:\n    > grunt test\n\n    # Run end-to-end tests (make sure to first start a web server as specified below)\n    > grunt karma:e2e\n\n    # Run midway tests\n    > grunt karma:midway\n\n### End-to-end tests\n\nThe e2e tests need a webserver to run. A simple one from the angular-seed project is included:\n\n    > ./scripts/web-server.js\n\n### Automated testing and building\n\nRunning this task will automatically rebuild `build/ng-grid.debug.js` when source files change, and run unit tests when `build/ng-grid.debug.js` or unit test files change. Youc an use this for testing during development.\n\n    # Run this in its own window\n    > grunt testwatch\n\n### Integration testing\n\nThere is a task for CI testing with PhantomJS\n\n1. Make sure the PHANTOMJS_BIN environment variable  is set properly\n2. PhantomJS with the singleRun option doesn't appear to function properly in Windows. The tests will run but PhantomJS will not automatically close.\n3. This task first builds the debug version of the source files and does not clean them up. If you run it you will have uncommitted changes in your working directory that you probably want to lose. `git checkout build` to lose them.\n\n    > grunt test-ci\n\n### Selecting browsers\n\nAll the test tasks accept a `--browsers` command line option that will be passed to karma.\n    \n    # Automatically re-run tests in both Chrome and FF.\n    grunt testwatch --browsers=Chrome,Firefox\n",
